Electrical sales forecasting involves databases focused on analyzing diverse facets of electrical sales, encompassing factors influencing sales trends, patterns, and outcomes to predict future market drivers and provide insights for enhancing sales strategies, optimizing revenue, and mitigating potential market impacts.

### Dataset
The initiative is spearheaded by our company and draws upon insights derived from a comprehensive dataset sourced from real-time sales data obtained internally

### Analysis Model
ARIMA and exponential smoothing methods are well-suited for time series data with temporal structure, including data exhibiting seasonality, trends, and other regular patterns. They are particularly useful when the data are stationary or can be made stationary, and they can handle noisy or irregular patterns effectively.

### Data Visualization
PowerBI is employed for effective data visualization. Interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive view, facilitating the identification of patterns, trends, and correlations in electrical forcasting data.
